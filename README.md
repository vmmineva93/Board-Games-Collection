# Board-Games-Collection
My First Angular Project for a Board Games Collection. It provides a public area where visitors can view the collection and game details, and a private area where registered users can add to the collection. 

# Run the Project

## 1. Install the Dependencies
- Open an integrated terminal in the client folder and type:

```sh
npm install

```

## 2. Run the Server
- Open an integrated terminal in the server folder and type:

```sh
node server

```

## 3. Run the Client
- Open an integrated terminal in the client folder and type:

```sh
npm ng serve

```
## The service is initialized with three users, which can be used for immediate testing:

- peter@abv.bg : 123456
- george@abv.bg : 123456
- admin@abv.bg : admin
